    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Effective date: 31 Aug 2025</p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how <strong>YOUR_COMPANY_OR_NAME</strong> (“we”, “us”, “our”) collects, uses, and safeguards information in the <strong>Sneha &amp; Shreyansh</strong> wedding app and website (<em>the “Service”</em>).</p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We don’t sell your data or use it for advertising.</li>
      <li>Photos you upload are stored securely in our Firebase project.</li>
      <li>You control your uploads. Ask us to delete them at any time.</li>
      <li>We use anonymous sign-in to create a private, app-only user ID.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Process</h2>
    <h3>1) User-Generated Content</h3>
    <p><strong>Photos &amp; videos you upload</strong> to the gallery are stored in Firebase Storage and referenced in Cloud Firestore. Each item includes a URL, storage path, an internal user ID, upload timestamp, and a visibility flag (<code>public</code> or <code>private</code>).</p>

    <h3>2) Identifiers</h3>
    <p>We use <strong>Firebase Authentication (Anonymous)</strong> to create a non-personal <em>User ID (UID)</em> for basic app functionality (e.g., “my uploads”). This UID does not contain your name, email, or phone unless you later choose to sign in with an identity provider.</p>

    <h3>3) Technical Data</h3>
    <p>We do not use analytics or crash reporting SDKs. Standard web/server logs may be created when you access the website. We use <strong>Firebase App Check</strong> (with reCAPTCHA on web) to protect the Service from abuse; Google may receive limited information to provide this protection as described in the reCAPTCHA terms.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Provide app features (gallery, events, pages controlled by feature flags).</li>
      <li>Protect the Service (fraud/abuse prevention via App Check and basic authentication).</li>
      <li>Moderate or remove inappropriate content if necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> sell your data. We use service providers solely to run the Service:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Google Firebase</strong> (Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage) – hosting and processing.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> – hosts the static website front-end.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Legal Basis (if you are in the EEA/UK)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Performance of a contract / legitimate interests</em> for running the app features.</li>
      <li><em>Consent</em> for optional uploads and public sharing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Retention</h2>
    <p>Uploads are kept until you delete them or request deletion. We may periodically archive or remove content after the wedding unless you ask us to keep it longer.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices &amp; Rights</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You may request deletion of your uploads and associated records.</li>
      <li>You may request a copy of your data and information about processing.</li>
      <li>To make a request, email us at <a href="mailto:YOUR_EMAIL">enquiry@shreyanshajmera.com</a>. We aim to respond within 30 days.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is not intended for children under 13. If a child’s image was uploaded without permission, contact us and we will remove it.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>Data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Firebase. We also enforce Firebase security rules to restrict writes. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, but we regularly review our safeguards.</p>

    <h2>International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Firebase may process data on servers outside your country. Where required, appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses) are in place through Google.</p>

    <h2>Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update this Policy. The “Effective date” will reflect the latest version. Significant changes will be communicated within the app/website.</p>
